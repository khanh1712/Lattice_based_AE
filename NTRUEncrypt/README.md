## Note:

- This NTRU is based on algorithm stated in '__NTRU: A Ring-Based Public Key Cryptosystem by Jeffrey Hoffstein, Jill Pipher, Joseph H. Silverman__'.
- Parameters are now used to fit with QUAM encode 16. However, some experiments need to take in order to meansure the security of the modification.
- Input of the encryption is a vector of complex numbers in which there are no 0.
- Output is also same as input.
